The filter module
=================

This module started with a simple idea. I wanted an environment
    
    \startmarkdown
    ...
    \stopmarkdown

to write content in Markdown. Such an environment requires a parser that
converts markdown to TeX. A TeX wizard would write such a parser in TeX (which
after all is Turing complete). A lua wizard would write it in LPEG (and wonder
why some users still use MkII). I, being no wizard myself, found an existing
tool that does the job---pandoc. But how could I use pandoc inside ConTeXt?

As for almost everything else in ConTeXt, Hans had already done this; albeit for
a different tool---the R programming language.  The _R
module_ (`m-r.tex`) allows the user to execute snippets of R code. I wanted the
same for Markdown.

I copied the R-module, made a couple of changes, and had a Markdown module
ready. But what if tomorrow I wanted to use ReStructured Text instead of
Markdown? Or Matlab code instead R? Surely, copying the R-module for each
program would be a waste of effort. Each new program requires only a few changes
in the R-module; what I needed was a R-module _template_ so that I could fill in
the blanks with the appropriate values. And so, the filter module was born.

Compatibility
------------

This module works with both MkII and MkIV.

Installation
------------

Writing installation instructions is always boring. If you are using ConTeXt
standalone, you can install the module using

    first-setup.sh --modules="t-filter"

Depending on your TeX distribution, you may already have the module.
To verify, check if

    luatools t-filter.mkiv

returns a meaningful path. If not, you have to manually install the module.

Download the latest version of the module from
[http://modules.contextgarden.net/filter](http://modules.contextgarden.net/filter)
and unzip it either `$TEXMFHOME` or `$TEXMFLOCAL`. Run

    mtxrun --generate

and

    mktexlsr

to refresh the TeX file database (for MkIV and MkII, respectively). If
everything went well

    luatools t-filter.mkiv

will return the path where you stored the file.

Unfortunately, that is not enough. For the module to work, TeX must be able to
call an external program. This feature is a potential security risk and is
disabled by default on most TeX distributions. To enable this feature in MkII, set

    shell_escape=t

in your `texmf.cnf` file. See this page
[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/write18](http://wiki.contextgarden.net/write18)
on the ConTeXt wiki for detailed instructions.

Basic Usage
-----------

The steps involved in calling a filter on the contents of an environment are:

1. Write the contents to an external file. This file is the input to the filter,
   and is, therefore, called `\externalfilterinputfile`

2. Run the filter on `\externalfilterinputfile` to generate an output, which is
   called `\externalfilteroutputfile`.

3. (Optional) Read `\externalfilteroutputfile` in ConTeXt.

Lets start from the simplest case: a filter that inputs a text file and outputs
a valid ConTeXt file, like `pandoc` to convert from Markdown to ConTeXt. The
command line syntax of this filter is

    pandoc -t context -o outputfile inputfile

Using this filter from within ConTeXt is pretty simple:

    \usemodule[filter]

    \defineexternalfilter
        [markdown]
        [filtercommand={pandoc -t context -o \externalfilteroutputfile\space \externalfilterinputfile}]

Yes, its that easy! The only thing to note is that TeX macros gobble spaces, so
I inserted a manual space after `\externalfilteroutputfile`.

The above `\defineexternalfilter` macro defines:

1. An environment

        \startmarkdown
          ...
        \stopmarkdown

     The contents of the environment are processed by `pandoc` and the output is
     included back in ConTeXt.

2. A macro

        \inlinemarkdown{...}

     The argument of the macro is processed by `pandoc` and the output is included
     back in ConTeXt.

3. A macro

        \processmarkdownfile{...}

     The argument to the macro is a filename, which is processed by `pandoc` and
     the output is included back in ConTeXt.

4. A macro
    
        \processmarkdownbuffer[...]

     The argument to the macro is the name of a buffer, which is written to an
     external file, processesd by `pandoc` and the output included back in
     ConTeXt.

The [wiki](https://github.com/adityam/filter/wiki) page on Github gives the
setup for common usecases (pandoc, R, etc.)

Inheriting setup from other commands
-------------------------------------

It is also possible to inherit the settings from another filter. For example, 

    \defineexternalfilter
      [filterstyle]
      [color=red,
       style=bold]

    \defineexternalfilter 
      [markdown]
      [filterstyle]
      [filter={pandoc -w context -o \externalfilteroutputfile },
       style=italic]

Notice the three arguments to `\defineexternalfilter`. The first argument
(`markdown`) is the name of the new filter; the second argument (`filterstyle`)
is the name of the filter whose settings we want to inherit, and the third
argument (`filter=...`) are the new settings for `markdown` filter. The above
definition is same as:

    \defineexternalfilter
      [filter={pandoc -w context -o \externalfilteroutputfile },
       style=italic,
       color=red]

Note that if a setting (like `style` above) is defined both in the new filter
and the parent filter, then the value of the new filter (`style=italic` above)
is used.

Dealing with slow filters
-------------------------

The above definition of a markdown filter creates two additional files: an
"input" file and an "output" file, *irrespective of the
number of times the environment is called*. For each markdown environment,
ConTeXt overwrites the input file and pandoc overwrites the output
file; as a result, the current directory is not cluttered with temporary files.
The trade off is that for each document run, the filter is
invoked as many times as the number of markdown environments. Since getting
cross-referencing right normally takes two to three runs, effectively the filter
is run two or three times more than required. A filter like `pandoc` is fairly
fast, so these extra runs are not noticeable. But some filters, like the
R-programming language for which simply startup and exit takes about 0.3
seconds, are slow. In such cases, the additional runs start adding up. A better
trade off is to store the contents of each environment in a separate file and
invoke the filter only if a file *changes in between successive runs*.

The second behavior is achieved by adding `cache=yes` option to the
definition:

    \defineexternalfilter
        [...]
        [...
         cache=yes,
         ...]

Sometimes you want to force the rerun of a filter, even if the content of the
environment has not changed. This could be because the filters depend on an
external script that might have changed. To force a rerun of a filter use


    \defineexternalfilter
        [...]
        [...
         cache=force,
         ...]

Reading the input
----------------

By default, after the filter is executed, `\externalfilteroutputfile` is read
using `\ReadFile`. To change this behavior, use the `readcommand` option. For
example:

    \defineexternalfilter
      [...]
      [....
       readcommand=\typefile,
       ...]

types the output file verbatim. The value of read command must be a macro that
takes the name of the output file as a (brace-delimited) argument and does
something sensible with it. 

Sometimes, it is desirable to ignore the output, which is done by

    \defineexternalfilter
      [...]
      [....
       read=no,
       ...]

Space around the environment
----------------------------

By default, the `\start<...>` ... `\stop<...>` and the `\type<...>file{...}`
variant displays the output is _paragraph_ mode (i.e., inserts blanks before and
after the environment), while the `\inline{...}` variant reads the output in
_text_ mode (i.e., does not insert blanks before or after the environment).

To change the amount of space inserted before and after the environment, use the
`spacebefore` and the `spaceafter` keys. For example, if you want big spaces
around the environment use:

    \defineexternalfilter
      [...]
      [....
       spacebefore=big,
       spaceafter=big,
       ...]

The `spacebefore` and `spaceafter` keys accept all values accepted by the
`\blank[...]` macro.

In the paragraph mode, the next line after `\stop<...>` is indented or not based
on the value of the `indentnext` key. The default value is `auto` which indents
the next line if there is an empty line after `\stop<...>`; other options are
`no`, which never indents the next line and `yes` which always indents the next
line.

If you want the `\start<...>` ... `\stop<...>` and the `\type<...>file{...}`
variant to behave in _text_ mode, set:

    \defineexternalfilter
      [...]
      [....
       location=text,
       ...]

(The default value of `location` is `paragraph`). 

**Note** that `location=text` is not equivalent to `\inline{...}`. Inline also
sets `\endlinechar=\minusone`; therefore no space is inserted when the file is
read. `location=text` does not change `\endlinechar`. Therefore a space is
inserted after the file is read. 

Stripping leading whitespace (MkIV only)
----------------------------------------

By default, the leading whitespace is removed before the content of the filter
environment are saved to an external file. This is useful because one can then
indent the TeX code without worring how the leading whitespaces will be
interpretted by the filter. For example,

    \startitemize
      \item 
        \startmarkdown
            This is treated as regular text. If the leading spaces were not
            stripped, this would be treated as a code block in markdown.
        \stopmarkdown
    \stopitemize

If you want to keep the leading whitespace, you can set

    \defineexternalfilter
      [...]
      [....
       strip=no,
       ...]

(The default value is `yes`).

Names of temporary files
------------------------

By default, `\externalfilterinputfile` is set to `\jobname-temp-<filter>.tmp`, where
`<filter>` is the first argument of `\defineexternalfilter`. When `cache=yes`
is set, `\externalfilterinputfile` equals `\jobname-temp-<filter>-<n>.tmp`, where
`<n>` is the number of filter environments that have appeared so far. In MkII,
a `\jobname-temp-<filter>-<n>.tmp.md5` file, which stores the `md5` sum of the
input file is also created.

A macro `\externalfilterbasefile` stores the name of the input file without the
extension. By default, the value of `\externalfilteroutputfile` is
`\externalfilterbasefile.tex`. Having a `.tex` extension is not always
desirable. For example, if the filter generates a PNG file, a `.png` extension
is more descriptive. The name of the output file is changed using the `output`
key. For example

    \defineexternalfilter
        [...]
        [filtercommand={...},
         output={\externalfilterbasefile.png}]

changes the output extension to `.png`. To read the generated PNG file, set:

    \defineexternalfilter
      [...]
      [....
       readcommand=\readPNGfile,
       ...]

where `\readPNGfile` is defined as

    \def\readPNGfile#1{\externalfigure[#1]}

Output Directory
----------------

This module creates a lot of temporary files that clutter the current directory.
If you prefer the temporary files to be created in another directory, use
the `directory` option, e.g.,

    \defineexternalfilter
      [...]
      [...
       directory=output/,
      ...]

This will create all the temporary files in `output` directory. The name of the
directory may be specified with or without a trailing slash. Thus,
`directory=output` and `directory=output/` are both valid. 

The directory path **must be relative to the current directory**. Absolute paths
do not work. If you try to use a absolute path like

    \defineexternalfilter
      [...]
      [...
       directory=/tmp/,
      ...]

you will get an error message

    t-filter        > Fatal Error: Cannot use absolute path /tmp/ as directory

and compilation will stop.

Disabling filters
----------------

Adding `state=stop` option disables the filters. The
`\externalfilterinputfile` is still written, but the filter is not run.

When used in conjunction with `cache=yes` and `directory=...`, this
is useful for sharing your files with others who do not have the
external program that you are using. 

Deleting temporary files
------------------------

In MkIV, the module automatically deletes the `\externalfilterinputfile` after
executing the filter unless `\traceexternalfilters` is used. If, for whatever
reason, you want to keep this file around, use

    \defineexternalfilter
        [...]
        [...
         purge=no,
         ...]

In MkII, the `\externalfilterinputfile` is not deleted.

All the files generated by the filter module have `-temp-` in their name. As
such they can be deleted using

    context --purgeall --pattern=filename

Do **not** use the file extension. To delete all temporary files in the
current directory, use

    context --purgeall


Standard options
---------------

`\defineexternalfilter` accepts the following standard options:

- `spacebefore` and `spaceafter` to specify the blank space to be used 
   before and after the environment. 
- `before` and `after`: to enclose the output in a frame, etc. (only if
  `location` is `paragraph`)
- `left` and `right`: same as `before` and `after` but used when `location` is
  not `paragraph`.
- `style` and `color`: to set the color and style of the output.
- `align`: to set the alignment of the output (only if
  `location` is `paragraph`).
- `indentnext`: specify if the next line is indented (only if `location` is
  `paragraph`).
- `setups`: specify a list of setups (defined using `\startsetups`). These
  setups may be used to define commands that are needed inside the environment.

The order in which these options are executed are:

1. `\blank[spacebefore]`
2. `before/left
3. `align` (if `location=paragraph`)
4. `style` and `color`
5. `setups`
6. `readcommand`
7. `after/right
8. `\blank[afterspace]`
9. check `indentnext`

Options to a specific environment
---------------------------------

Each `\start<filter>` macro also accepts options. However, unlike other ConTeXt
environment, these options cannot be on a separate line; they must be on the same
line as `\start<filter>`. For example, suppose I define an environment to run
R-code

    \defineexternalfilter
      [R]
      [filtercommand={R CMD BATCH -q  \externalfilterinputfile\space \externalfilteroutputfile},
       output=\externalfilterbasefile.out,
       cache=yes]

I can hide the output of a particular R-environment by

    \startR[read=no]
    ...
    \stopR

The macros `\processmarkdownfile` and `\processmarkdownbuffer` also accept user
options. The usage is

    \processmarkdownfile  [.-.=.-.]{filename}
    \processmarkdownbuffer[...=...][buffer]


A setup to control them all
---------------------------

The macro `\setupexternalfilters` sets the default options for all the filters
created using `\defineexternalfilter`. This is responsible for the default values
of all options. The current defaults are

    \setupexternalfilters
      [before=,
       after=,
       setups=,
       cache=no,
       read=yes,
       readcommand=\ReadFile,
       output=\externalfilterbasefile.tex,
      ]


Passing options to filters
--------------------------

**NOTE** This option does not work for MkII or for inline snippets

Sometimes it is useful to pass options to a filter. For example, `pandoc`
converts many different formats to ConTeXt (actually, to many different output
formats, but that is irrelevant here). Instead of defining a separate
environment for each input format, can I define a universal pandoc environment
and specify the input format on a case by case basis. For example,

    \startpandoc
    ...
    \stoppandoc

for the default Markdown input,

    \startpandoc[format=rst]
    ...
    \stoppandoc

for reStructured Text input, and

    \startpandoc[format=latex]
    ...
    \stoppandoc

for LaTeX input. In `pandoc`, the input format is specified as

    pandoc -f format -t context -o outputfile inputfile

So, we need a mechanism to access the value of the `format` option to
`\startpandoc`. This value is accessed using `\externalfilterparameter{format}`.
Thus, the pandoc environment may be defined as

    \defineexternalfilter
      [pandoc]
      [filtercommand={pandoc -f \externalfilterparameter{format} -t context 
                       -o \externalfilteroutputfile\space \externalfilterinputfile},
       format=markdown]

Macro variant
-------------

For some cases, a macro `\inline<filter>{...}` is more natural to use rather
than the environment `\start<filter>` ... `\stop<filter>`. The `\inline...`
variant is meant for simple cases, so it does not accept any options in square
brackets. This macro is similar to `\type` macro, and its argument can be
written in two ways: either as a group `{...}` or delimited by arbitrary tokens.
Thus, all the following are valid:

    \defineexternalfilter[markdown][...]

    \inlinemarkdown{both braces{}}

    \inlinemarkdown+an opening brace {+

    \inlinemarkdown!a closing brace }!

**Note** Inline mode sets `\endlinechar=\minusone`; therefore no space is
inserted after a newline. This may lead to unexpected results if the output of
the filter is wrapped into multiple lines. For example, if the output of the
filter is

    This is a long line that is wrapped
    after a fixed number of characters.

Then, when reading the file the space between `wrapped` and `after` will be
lost! To avoid that pass appropriate options to the filter program so that it
does not wrap long lines.

Processing existing Files
-------------------------

A big advantage of a lightweight markup language like markdown is that it is
easy to convert it into other markups--html, rtf, epub, etc. For that reason, I
key in markdown in a separate file rather in a start-stop environment of a TeX
file. To use such markdown files in ConTeXt, I can just use

    \processmarkdownfile{filename.md}

By default, the file is searched the current directory and in the directories
specified by `\usepath`. In addition, in MkIV, the parent and grand-parent
directories are also searched. If the file is not in one of these locations,
specify a full or a relative path to the file.

The general macro is `\process<filter>file{...}`, which takes the name of a file
**or a url (MkIV only)** as an argument and uses that file as the input file for
the filter. The rest of the processing is the same as with `\start<filter>` ...
`\stop<filter>` environment. 

The `\process<filter>file` macro also takes an optional argument for setup
options:

    \process<filter>file[...]{...}

The options in the `[...]` are the same as those for `\defineexternalfilter`.

Processing remote files
-----------------------

**NOTE** Only works in MkIV

The `\process<filter>file{...}` macro also processes remote files specified
using URLs. For example, to see a typeset version of this manual, use

    \processmarkdownfile{https://raw.github.com/adityam/filter/master/README.md}

This macro downloads the file in the background, and processes the local file using
`pandoc`. To prevent frequent downloads, the downloaded file is cached and the
file is re-downloaded only if the cached file is more than 1 day old. You can
override the default threshold using `schemes.threshold` directive. For example,
if you want to re-download the file every 5 minutes (= 300 seconds), add

    \enabledirectives[schemes.threshold=300]

somewhere before `\starttext` or use

    context --directives=schemes.threshold=300 <filename>

to compile the file. 

To see where the cached file is stored, add

    \enabletrackers[resolvers.schemes]

or use

    context --trackers=resolvers.schemes <filename>

to compile the file.

Processing existing buffers
---------------------------

Like all macros built on top of buffers, the `\start<filter>` ...
`\stop<filter>` environment does not work well inside the argument of another
command. The `\process<filter>buffer` macro is handy for such macros.

Suppose you want to write some markdown text in a footnote. Using

    \footnote{ .... 
       \startmarkdown
          ...
       \stopmarkdown}

gives an error message:

    ! File ended while scanning use of \dododowithbuffer.

    system          > tex > error on line 0 in file : File ended while scanning use
    of \dododowithbuffer ...

    <empty file>

    <inserted text> 
                    \par 

To avoid this, define a buffer at the outer level 

    \startbuffer[footnote-markdown]
       ...
    \stopbuffer

and then use

    \footnote{... \processmarkdownbuffer[footnote-markdown]}

The `\process<filter>buffer` macro also takes an optional argument for setup
options:

    \process<filter>buffer[...][...]

The options in the first `[...]` are the same as those for `\defineexternalfilter`.


Prepend and append text
-----------------------

**NOTE** Only works in MkIV

Some external programs require boilerplate text at the beginning and end of each
file. Including this boilerplate code in each snippet can get verbose. The
filter module provides two options `bufferbefore` and `bufferafter` to shorten
such snippets. Define the boilerplate code in ConTeXt buffers and then use

    \defineexternalfilter
        [...]
        [...
         bufferbefore={...list of buffers...},
         bufferafter={...list of buffers...},
        ]

For example, suppose you want to generate images using a LaTeX package that does
not work well with ConTeXt, say `shak`. One way to use this is as follows: first
define a file that processes its content using `latex`.

        \defineexternalfilter
            [chess]
            [filter=pdflatex,
             output=\externalfilterbasefile.pdf,
             readcommand=\readPDFfile,
            ]

        \def\readPDFfile#1{\externalfigure[#1]}


Next create buffers containing boilerplate code needed to run latex:

       \startbuffer[chess::before]
        \documentclass{minimal}
        \usepackage{skak}
        \usepackage[active,tightpage]{preview}

        \begin{document}
        \begin{preview}
        \newgame
        \hidemoves{
      \stopbuffer

      \startbuffer[chess::after]
        }
        \showboard
        \end{preview}
        \end{document}
      \stopbuffer

and tell the filter to prepend and append these buffers

      \setupexternalfilter
        [chess]
        [bufferbefore={chess::before},
         bufferafter={chess::after}]

Then you can use

      \inlinechess{1.e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5}

to get a chess board.

Special use case:  `\write18` with caching
------------------------------------------

Although the raison d'Ãªtre of the externalfilter module is to process the
content of an evironment or a macro through an external program, it may also be
used to simply exectute an external program without processing any content.

For example, suppose we want to include an image with a swirl gradient in our
document. ImageMagick can generate such an image using:

     convert -size 100x100 gradient: -swirl 180 <output file>

Notice that in this case, the external program does not need any input file. We
just need to pass the size of the image to the external program. 

In such cases, we still want to cache the result, i.e., rerun the external
program only when the `size` of the image has changed. The `write=no` option
covers this use case. The basic usage is:

    \defineexternalfilter
        [...]
        [
          ...
          write=no,
          cacheoption=....,
          ...
        ]

Out of the four macros (see [Basic Usage]) created by `\defineexternalfilter`,
only `\inline<externalfilter>` makes sense with `write=no`. The usage of this
macro is

    \inline<externalfilter>[....]

Unlike the default case, this version does not take an argument! (That is
because, it does not write anything to a file). 

When `write=no` is set, `\externalfilterbasefile` is equal to
`\jobname-temp-<filter>-<cacheoption>` where `<cacheoption>` is the value of the
`cacheoption` key. 

For example, to generate swirl backgrounds described above, define:

    \defineexternalfilter
        [swirl]
        [
          write=no,
          cacheoptions={\externalfilterparameter{size}},
          cache=yes,
          size={1000x1000},
          output=\externalfilterbasefile.png,
          filtercommand={convert -size \externalfilterparameter{size} gradient: -swirl 180 \externalfilteroutputfile},
          readcommand=\ReadFigure,
        ]

    \def\ReadFigure#1%
        {\externalfigure[#1]}


This creates a macro `\inlineswirl` that uses ImageMagick to generate a file
`\jobname-temp-swirl-1000x1000.png`. 

The result is cached and the external program is rerun only if the value of
cacheoption changes, that is, only if the value of `size` key changes. 


Dealing with expansion
----------------------

All the arguments of `filtercommand` must be fully expandable. Sometimes,
writing an expandable command is tricky.  For example, suppose you want to use
GNU barcode to draw barcodes. One way to do this is


    \defineexternalfilter
      [barcode]
      [encoding=code128,
       output=\externalfilterbasefile.eps,
       cache=yes,
       filtercommand=\barcodefiltercommand,
       readcommand=\barcodereadcommand]

    \def\barcodereadcommand#1%
      {\externalfigure[#1]}

    \def\barcodefiltercommand
      {barcode -i \externalfilterinputfile\space -o \externalfilterbasefile.eps\space
       -E % EPS output
       -e \externalfilterparameter{encoding}

One of the options that GNU barcode provides is

       -n     ``Numeric'' output: don't print the ASCII form of the code, only
               the bars.

The ideal way to support this option is to provide a `label=(yes|no)` option,
and in `\barcodefiltercommand` check the value of
`\externalfilterparameter{label}`. If this value is `no`, add a `-n` flag. That
is, redefine `\barcodefiltercommand` as follows:

    \def\barcodefiltercommand
      {barcode -i \externalfilterinputfile\space -o \externalfilterbasefile.eps\space
       -E % EPS output
       -e \externalfilterparameter{encoding}
       \doif{\externalfilterparameter{label}}{no}{-n} }

This approach does not work. The log says:

    t-filter    > command : barcode -i barcode-temp-barcode-1.tmp -o barcode-temp-barcode-1.eps -E -e code128 \edef {yes}\edef yes{no}

Instead of `-n`, we get `\edef {yes} \edef yes{no}` in the output. This is
because `\doif` macro is not fully expandable. 

One way to circumvent this limitation is to check for the value of `label`
outside the `filtercommand`. The filter module provides a `filtersetup` option
for this. For example, in  the above barcode example, use

    \def\barcodelabeloption{}

    \startsetups barcode:options
      \doifelse{\externalfilterparameter{label}}{no}
        {\edef\barcodelabeloption{-n}}
        {\edef\barcodelabeloption{}}
    \stopsetups

    \defineexternalfilter
        [barcode]
        [....
         filtersetups={barcode:options},
         filtercommand=\barcodefiltercommand,
         ...
        ]

    \def\barcodefiltercommand
      {barcode -i \externalfilterinputfile\space -o \externalfilterbasefile.eps\space
       -E % EPS output
       -e \externalfilterparameter{encoding}
       \barcodelabeloption % check for label
      }

Limitations
------------

- In MkII, the option `cache=yes` does not work correctly with filters that have a
  pipe `|` in their definition. This is because internally `cache=yes` calls

          mtxrun --ifchanged=filename --direct filtercommand

    and this produces
  
          MTXrun |
          MTXrun | executing: filtercommand
          MTXrun |
          MTXrun |

    In MkIV, `cache=yes` calls

          \ctxlua{job.files.run("filename", "filtercommand")}

    so filters with a `|` work correctly.

  

Messages and Tracing
-------------------

The filter module outputs some diagnostic information on the console output to
indicate what is happening. Loading of the module is indicated by:

    loading         : ConTeXt User Module / Filter (ver: <date>)

Whenever a filter is defined the expanded name of the command is displayed.
For example, for the markdown filter we get:

    t-filter        > command : pandoc -w context -o markdown-temp-markdown.tex markdown-temp-markdown.tmp

If, for some reason, the output file is not generated, or not found, a message
similar to

    t-filter        > file markdown-temp-markdown.tex cannot be found
    t-filter        > current filter : markdown
    t-filter        > base file : markdown-temp-markdown
    t-filter        > input file : markdown-temp-markdown.tmp
    t-filter        > output file : markdown-temp-markdown.tex

is displayed on the console. At the same time, the string 

    [[output file missing]]

is displayed in the PDF output. This data, along with the name of the filter
command, is useful for debugging what went wrong. To get more debugging
information add 

    \traceexternalfilters

in your tex file. This shows the name of the filters when they are defined.
In MkIV, `\traceexternalfilters` also enables the trackers for `graphic.run`, so
when `cache=yes` is used, message like

    graphics        > run > processing file, no changes in '<filename>-temp-<filtername>-<n>.tmp', not processed

are shown.

Version History
--------------

- **2010.09.26**: 
    - First release
- **2010.10.09**: 
    - Added `\inline<filter>{...}` macro 
    - Changed the syntax of `\process<filter>file`. The filename is now
      specified in curly brackets rather than square brackets.
- **2010.10.16**:
    - Added `\traceexternalfilters` for tracing
    - Added a message that shows filter command on console
    - A message is shown on console when output file is not found.
- **2010.10.30**:
    - Added `directory=...` option to `\defineexternalfilter` and
      `\setupexternalfilters`.
- **2010.12.04**:
    - Bug fix in `directory` code. The option `directory=../something` was
      handled incorrectly.
- **2011.01.28**
    - Bug fix. The filter counter was not incremented inside a group. Made the
      increment global.
- **2011.02.21**
    - Added `style` and `color` options.
- **2011.02.27**
    - The external files are called `\jobname-temp-<filter>*` instead of
      `\jobname-externalfilter-<filter>*`. As a result, these files are deleted
      by `context --purgeall`.
- **2011.03.06**
    - Complete rewrite of internal macro names. The internal macros are now
      named `\modulename::command_name`. This is an experiment to see if this
      style works better than the traditional naming convention in TeX.
- **2011.06.16**
    - Added `force` mode to force recompilation of all filters that have
      `continue=yes`. 
    - Added `reuse` mode to skip running all filters that have
      `continue=yes`. 
    - Added `state=stop` option to skip running external filter.
- **2011.08.23**
    - Added `bufferbefore` and `bufferafter` options
- **2011.08.28**
    - Internal change: Defined own macros for setting attributes rather than
      using built-in ones.
- **2011.09.03**
    - Added `filtersetups` 
- **2011.09.14**
    - `\inline<filter>` now accepts optional arguments.
    - `before=` and `after=` keys are disabled in `\inline<filter>`
- **2011.10.22**
    - Added `\process<filter>buffer`
- **2011.12.04**
    - Use `job.files.run` instead of `mtxrun --ifchanged` in MkIV.
- **2011.12.17**
    - Split into `.mkii` and `.mkiv` versions
- **2012.01.26**
    - Renamed `continue` to `cache`. Using `continue=yes` still works
    - Removed `force` and `reuse` modes (too easy to clash with user modes).
    - Functionality of force mode implemented using `cache=force`. 
- **2012.02.05**
    - Added `purge=yes|no` to control if the input file is deleted or not
- **2012.03.18**
    - Process remote files
- **2012.04.18**
